This should give acceptable results. \n\n\nMany thanks to huwb and his Anatomy of an explosion shader, I got a great start for an explosion effect\nthat I was desiring so much.\n\nExtending it over time though did not result in a believable explosion effect. It looks like\na still cloud with more parts appearing instead of a moving, growing explosion.\n\nAs a start, I just made a growing sphere that eats up the density from inside.\n(The introductory \"den\" calculation in densityFn with ballness, growth and fade).\nIt looks nice for the fading-away of an explosion, but it is not enough yet.\n\nMany thanks to iq and his mathematical frameworks which brought so many shaders to live and\nrevealed the beauty of mathematics.\n\nIt's especially his beautiful Hell shader (one of my favourites) and his idea of space inversion\nwhich gave me the final idea for the explosion effect.\nThe space inversion actually converts a directional moving cloud space into a growing cloud effect.\n\nIt is the nature of this effect that it grows on one end but shrinks in on the opposite.\nTo compensate on that, I could only realize composing multiple explosion balls like such to hide the\nshrinking-in hemispheres as much as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, I only found a way to superpose these balls by having them independently\nmerged in color. That is, their animations do not interfere with each other, which is absolutely not\na realistic effect. It is not even a physical approximation.\nNot that there would be anything in this shader near physical correctness, but it can be seen\nthat the balls are independent.\n\nI tried to fiddle with space inversion and cloud movements in multiple directions at once (instead of just one)\non just one explosion ball. It would melt the explosion to one cloud peace instead of being multiple independent\nballs, but it always built up undesirable seams and stretched parts of the cloud which makes\nthe explosion not be an explosion at all anymore.\n(Although it looks quite fancy on its own which goes in the direction of a bent sun bursts similar effect).\n\nAnother disadvantage with the multiple balls is the need to sample noise space for each ball\nseparately, which eats up speed power rather quickly.\nBut I could not find a way around that.\n\nThe fog I did add just for fun. I like this algorithm so much. It just needs a hand full of iterations\nand yet the effect looks convincing even with a moving and rotating camera without any jumps or glitches.\nThanks to nimitz and his Xyptonjtroz shader (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ts3z2).\n\nOut of lazyness and for the reason that the main purpose of this shader is just the explosion,\nI draw the explosion over the fog, always, no matter if fog layers actually should be before the explosion.\n\nI would have liked the explosion effect to suffice on just such a small number of iterations.\n\nBut well, the explosion looks relatively believable and I still like to look at it,\nso I am not unsatisfied.\n\nI also added the stars just for fun because I like bjarkeck's simple algorithm with the so believable result.\n\nAnd when playing around with night scenery setting, I discovered this great look of corridor light\nby accident, so I had to keep it. :-) Just have a look on the nice shine the corridor light spreads a bit\naround the top of the big columns and near the stairs. Pure luck.\n*/\n\n\n\n// In calcDens(), description mentions a bug which appeared with the old coloring.\n//#define OLD_COLORING\n\n// if not defined, mouse y will move camera\n// if defined, mouse y will override animation time stamp\n//#define ALTERNATE_MOUSE\n\n// for (slight) speed improvement, use low quality fbm and noise and compensate with some settings adjustments\n// if not defined, high quality\n// if 1, medium quality. acceptable.\n// if 2, low quality. not acceptable anymore.\n// Notice, 1 and 2 have approximately the same speed when putting also the compensation adjustments.
